# List of datasets

* `channel_attribution.csv`: The dataset is structured by having engagement activities as columns and the rows being 
the channels that were engaged with, in chronological order. In this case, each marketing channel is assigned a fixed 
numbered value which is then displayed in a column $n$ if the $n$â€™th engagement from a given user was with that marketing 
channel. Channel 21 is a conversion and our dataset only contains records of converting user journeys.
